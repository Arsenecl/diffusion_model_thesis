# Score-Based Generative Models with SDEs

This repository contains the code and research material from my Master's research internship at Université Paris Dauphine – PSL (May–July 2025), under the supervision of Yating Liu.

The project explores the theoretical and practical aspects of score-based generative models built on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with a particular focus on time-reversal dynamics, score estimation using neural networks, and convergence guarantees such as Wasserstein bounds.
